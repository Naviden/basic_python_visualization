# Python Visualization Basics

This repository provides a short tutorial on the basics of visualization in Python, created for a 2-hour lesson. The main objective is to introduce the fundamentals of Matplotlib and guide you through building several plots from scratch to practice the essential components of Matplotlib.

## How to Use This Repository

1. **Begin with Matplotlib Introduction:**
   If you are new to Python and/or Matplotlib, start with the [Matplotlib Introduction](https://github.com/Naviden/basic_python_visualization/blob/master/An%20Introduction%20to%20Matplotlib.ipynb). This notebook covers the basics of the library.
   
2. **Study the First Case Study:**
   Once you are familiar with Matplotlib, proceed to the [first case study](https://github.com/Naviden/basic_python_visualization/blob/master/Case%20Study/Case_Study_1.ipynb). This lesson guides you step-by-step in creating the following plots:
