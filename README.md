A short tutorial on basics of the visualization in Python. Created for a 2 hour lesson, the main objective is to show the fundamentals of Matplotlib and built several plots from scratch in order to practice the most important components of Matplotlib. You'll also find brief descriptions and examples of *Seaborn*, *Bokeh*, *Plotly* and *Dash* libraries.

In this lesson we are going make the following plots:
